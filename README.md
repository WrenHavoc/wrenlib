# -------------[Wren's library]-------------
just a library I use for some of my projects

all you need to do is clone this repo in your project
to call functions, you'll have to import them
the format is
from wrenlib.[file] import [def]

[file] refers to the file that contains the definition. Do not write a file extension, just the name of the file
[def] refers to the definition you want to import

Yes, this system is SUPER inefficient, but it's really easy to use.
